    <h>Skills</h>
    <p>I have developed a strong foundation in programming and computer science concepts, and I am continuously improving my technical abilities. My core skills include C, C++, Java basics, and Python fundamentals, along with good knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. I also have hands-on experience with problem-solving, debugging, and building small projects. Apart from technical skills, I am good at communication, teamwork, time management, and creative thinking, which help me perform well in both academic and personal projects. I always try to learn new tools and technologies to stay updated and grow as a developer.</p>
